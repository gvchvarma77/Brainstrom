WordPress Installtion

We will change directory to the /tmp directory. In Linux the /tmp directory is for placing stuff that you want to delete after the next boot up or in a pre-determind time, thus being called temporary.

cmd: cd /tmp

With the curl utility we will download the files of WordPress from the official WordPress website into our current /tmp direcotry.

cmd:curl -LO https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz

Now we will use the tar utility to untar the content of WordPress that we just downloaded. These are the actual files that WordPress uses.

cmd : tar xzvf latest.tar.gz

We will make a copy of the sample config file that WordPress comes with.

cmd: cp /tmp/wordpress/wp-config-sample.php /tmp/wordpress/wp-config.php

We will copy the entirity of the WordPress directory we just extracted to our public html directory.

sudo cp -a /tmp/wordpress/. /var/www/html


We can change the directory to verify that all the WordPress files are there.

cmd: cd /var/www/html && ls

We need to give ownership to a user and user group that NGINX creates, this user and group are called www-data. We will give it access to the directory where our WordPress files reside.

cmd: sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html 

Now WordPress can be managed by NGINX because it has the appropriate permissions.

We will move on to the WordPress application configuration. In the wp-config.php file we need to add certain salt keys to make things secure.

there are two ways to get the salt keys

way-1

cmd: curl -s https://api.wordpress.org/secret-key/1.1/salt/

way -2
 
go to the web browser

under url section give the following url 

url: https://api.wordpress.org/secret-key/1.1/salt/

to cofigure wordpress use the following command

sudo nano /var/www/html/wp-config.php

copy the slatkeys and give the keys in the wp-config.php

Then we provide the database name, database user and database password. In our example case that is wordpress, Wpuser, respectively

Below the database connection information, anywhere paste the following code.

With that setting WordPress is allowed to write directly to the file system. For example when uploading a new picture or plugin.

That is all for the wp-config.php.
